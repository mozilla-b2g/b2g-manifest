# This script is run by travis for the CI of b2g-manifest.
# It is designed to catch problems that would otherwise only
# be found when b2g bumper bot runs in production, that
# potentially can cause tree closures.

# It installs and runs b2g bumper locally, without committing
# nor pushing back to hg, to check that repos referenced exist
# and are readable, referenced heads/tags exist, and that they
# are correctly mirrored on git.mozilla.org.

# Gaia is excluded from testing, since access to cruncher is
# required to map hg sha to git sha, whereas these tests are
# more concerned with invalid repos/branches/tags getting
# added to a manifest.
